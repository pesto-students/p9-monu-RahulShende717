                        An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, would have many applications. It could be used to assist male or female couples in the 
                        development of a fetus.[2] This can potentially be performed as a switch from a natural uterus to an artificial uterus, thereby moving 
                        the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy.[2] In this sense, it can be regarded as a neonatal incubator with
                         very extended functions. It could also be used for the initiation of fetal development.[2] An artificial uterus could also help make fetal

                        <p></p>A woman may still supply nutrients and dispose of waste products if the artificial uterus is connected to her.[2] She may also
                         provide immune protection against diseases by passing of IgG antibodies to the embryo or fetus.[2]
                        
                       <p> Artificial supply and disposal have the potential advantage of allowing the fetus to develop in an environment that 
                        is not influenced by the presence of disease, environmental pollutants, alcohol, or drugs which a human may have in the
